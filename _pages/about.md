Welcome! I am an undergraduate researcher at [The University of Pittsburgh's](https://www.pitt.edu/) [Swanson School of Engineering](https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/).
I am affiliated with the [Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science](https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/mems), where I have
had the pleasure of collaborating with with [Paul Leu](http://lamp.pitt.edu/), [Matthew Barry](https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/people/faculty/matthew-barry/), 
and [Albert To](https://sites.pitt.edu/~albertto/) during my five years at Pitt. I will earn my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering with (expected) minors in
computer science and mathematics in the spring of 2022.

I am broadly interested in efficient computational methods, which led me to research topics ranging from heat transfer to topology optimizaiton during my 
undergraduate studies. My prior research has been published in *Energy* and presented at conferences like *VCT2020* and *HEFAT 2021*. Outside of academia, I work 
as a NASA Pathways Employee at the [Marshall Space Flight Center](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/home/index.html). Here, I developed an 
enthusiasm for control theory and aerial robotics, and I hope to pursue a PhD to study these topics next year.
