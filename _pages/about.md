Welcome! I am a graduate student interested in combining ideas from control theory and machine learning to enable safe and 
verifiable autonomous aerial systems. I am an incoming MPhil candidate at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) to study kernel operators and 
nonlinear control theory with the [Controls](http://www-control.eng.cam.ac.uk/) and [Machine Learning Groups](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/) – my studies at Cambridge are graciously supported by [The Churchill Scholarship](https://churchillscholarship.org/). 
Upon completion of my MPhil thesis, I intend to enroll at [Princeton University](https://mae.princeton.edu/) in the fall of 2023 under the support of the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). 

I graduated from The [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/mems) with a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science. 
During my undergraduate education, I was fortunate enough to complete three semesters of work at [NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/home/index.html) as a 
Pathways Employee. 

Outside of the lab, I enjoy running, hiking, reading, and checking out new coffee shops.
