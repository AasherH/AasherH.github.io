Listed below are some books that I read in 2021 (in no particular order). Alongside each book, you'll find some descriptions, 
high-level summaries, or notes that I took along the way. 

The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution
======

In this chronicle, Walter Isaacson, the world-class biographer, tells the history of 
computer science all the way from Ada Lovelace’s and Charles Babbage’s <i>Analytical Engine</i> to Sergey 
Brin’s and Larry Page’s <i>Google</i>. After having read Isaacson’s book on Albert Einstein, it 
became easy to believe that scientific and technological revolutions were spurred by
the brilliance of sole geniuses. Yet, this book constantly stressed how innovation is created by
having a diverse cohort of talented people working together: just look at Bell Labs and the team that created the 
transistor to see how one of the most important inventions of the Digital Age arose from grouping a pool of 
physicists, materials scientists, engineers, and experimentalists under one roof. In summary, this book taught me 
 that collaboration is key. 

The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer
======

Starting with ancient medicinal practices of the Greeks and concluding with modern oncology, this 
 tale follows the discovery of cancer and the tortuous path that its treatment took, ranging from the morbid radical surgeries of Halsted to the pharamcological 
 palliatives of today. Dr. Mukherjee ensures the reader walks away knowing that humanity and cancer have history, and that we are unfortunately likely to have a long 
 future with it too. 

Skunk Works: A Personal Memoir of My Years at Lockheed
======

Growing up, the SR71-Blackbird was my favorite aircraft. Capable of sustained Mach 3+ flight, this behemoth was one of the
most technologically advanced planes of its time. Ben Rich served as the second Director of Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works program, 
which was Lockheed's clandestine branch for the development of advanced aircraft and defense systems. Rich worked under the mentorship 
of legendary engineer Kelly Johnson, where he was a key proponent of the Blackbird's retractable air inlet (a decisive design choice that allowed the plane to 
transition from subsonic to supersonic flight). Like <i>The Innovators</i>, this book also carried some key business lessons, notably how 
startups/lean engineering teams need to "fail fast" and take calculated risks as necessary. As with the Blackbird, sometimes the risks pay off. 

The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History

Notes

The Gene: An Intimate History
======
<br/><img src='/images/books/2021-TheGene-SiddharthaMukherjee.JPG'>

This was the last book I finished on this list. After reading Dr. Mukherjee's <i>The Emperor of All Maladies</i>, I quickly
added <i>The Gene</i> to my Amazon shopping cart. In an alternate reality, I would have been a geneticist, and this evocative story about
the history of our DNA, of us, was hard to put down. An interesting fact I learned was how all mitochondrial DNA is inherited from maternal DNA, implying that
there is a single biological "mother" to all of us. Indeed, the matrilineal common ancestor to all modern humans was born about 200,000 years ago, aptly named 
"Mitochondrial Eve." 

While most of this book focuses on the history of the gene, Dr. Mukherjee spends the last few pages outlining the future of genetics research and warning 
us of the possible consequences that stem cell technologies, epigenetic modulation, and gene-editing methods could have on our society. 

Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup

Notes

Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress
======
<br/><img src='/images/books/2021-EnlightenmentNow-StevenPinker.PNG'>

Many news outlets and social media platforms tend to paint an overly depressing picture of the modern human condition, but is the media's portrayal of <i>Homo Sapiens</i> really as 
bleak as we make it out to be? Dr. Pinker explores this question by citing numerous studies and comes to the conclusion that, in general, humans are doing a good job. 
This book can be summarized by a quote from Barack Obama while speaking at the 2017 Goalkeepers conference: "If you had to choose one moment in history in which to be born, and you 
didn't know in advance whether you were going to be male or female, which country you were going to be from, what your status was, you'd choose right now."
